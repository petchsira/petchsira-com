I am known as petchsira. I'm a bus and public transport enthusiast!

My interest of buses and public transport first bloomed during my final year of middle school when an instructor of mine introduced me to an Airport Bus in Bangkok. My high school years then allowed me to explore them more. 

There's more to come, I hope so :)
