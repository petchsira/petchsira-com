I am known as petchsira. Currently a student in a 6-year course. A bus and public transport enthusiast, although currently trying to focus more on studies and other hobbies.

My interest of buses and public transport first bloomed during my final year of middle school when an instructor of mine introduced me to an Airport Bus in Bangkok. My high school years then allowed me to explore them more. 

School's interesting, although sometimes my hobbies do take time and end up overlapping my study time.

There's more to come, I hope so :)
