Trying to blog via code on an iPad is made viable in apps thanks to developers, but **writing your own code on Github** if you're on a budget can still cope with the limitations of not being able to access the PC in some circumstances.

Some people do use other platforms (e.g. Notion) for content management before submitting their own content via APIs, which sounds interesting.

As I'm still a novice with a lack in coding skills, I guess I'll continue to write it the budget method. :/
