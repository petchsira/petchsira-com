Words have rumored that this semester will surely feel better than the past ones, however things feel like the opposite to me. Learning is sped up significantly, subjects last roughly 2-4 weeks before an exam comes up and students move on to the next one.

Previous karma has been haunting me lately, nothing to blame but myself. But we all still need to move on and continue with life regardless of our emotions and outcomes, even if they affect us! right?

Exams are tomorrow, cheers, I'm outta here.
